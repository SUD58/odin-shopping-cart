# Odin Shopping Cart

A basic shopping cart built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
Built using React, this project focuses on:

- Routing and navigation with React Router
- Cart state management (add/remove/update items)
- Clean, component-based UI structure

This was one of my first projects exploring React as a frontend framework, with an emphasis on learning reusable patterns and organizing stateful logic.

**Note:** This is a learning project and may not include full styling or responsive design.
